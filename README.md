# FocusAPI

Java API for accessing course/grade information via Focus for Schools. Created using M2Eclipse, so make sure you have that set up if you're cloning into Eclipse.

Also note that currently the password masking used when logging in with test mode is incompatible with Eclipse, so if you want to use it, either export as a `.jar` and run from the commandline, or comment out the password input line in `src/test/java/com/slensky/FocusAPI/test.java` and hardcode in your password.
