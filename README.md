# FocusAPI

Java API for accessing course/grade information via Focus for Schools. Currently in very early development, very few things are functional. Contact me at [stephan.lensky@gmail.com](mailto:stephan.lensky@gmail.com) for more information.

Note that currently the password masking used when logging in with test mode is incompatible with Eclipse, so if you want to use it, either export as a `.jar` and run from the commandline, or comment out the password input line in `src/test/java/com/slensky/FocusAPI/test.java` and hardcode in your password.
